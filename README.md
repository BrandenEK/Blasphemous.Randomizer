## Seeds

In order to choose a specific seed that you want to play on, click on the seed text box and type the desired number on the settings menu shown before starting a new game.  Seeds can be in the range of 1 to 99,999,999.
<br><br>
In order to make it easier for multiple people to play with the same item generation (Such as for races or multiplayer), a sequence of 7 images is shown in the top right corner of the settings menu.  This is a unique identifier of the seed that also takes into account the other configuration settings and ensures that items will be placed exactly the same for all players.

## Randomizer info

### Important notes

- Only works on the most current game version (4.0.67)
- Press 'Numpad 6' to display the current seed (If you are stuck in dialogue use this to break out of it)
- Save & Quit can be used to instantly return to your last Prie Dieu, which can fix softlocks and makes the 'Return to Port' prayer useless
- Consult the spoiler generated in the game directory if you are stuck or believe the seed is unbeatable
- Do not load a vanilla game in the randomizer or vice versa
- Do not load an outdated randomized game in a newer version of the randomizer - seed generation is different

### Logic difficulty

Easy
- No skips or glitches will be necessary
- Only the expected method of reaching items will be considered in logic
- Bosses require an extra 10% strength to be in logic

Normal
- Using dawn heart skips & mid-air stalls may be necessary
- Tiento may be required to access items in poison clouds without Silvered Lung

Hard
- Mourning and Havoc skip may be required
- Slash Upwarp skips are considered in logic
- Dive Laser skips are considered in logic
- Some items in poison clouds are considered in logic without Tiento or Silvered Lung
- Bosses require 10% less strength to be in logic

  - Perpetva's item can be retrieved even after defeating Esdras
  - Crisanta will always hold the 'Holy Wound of Abnegation'
  - Crisanta does not have to beaten with the True Heart equipped in order to obtain the holy wound, it just has to be in your inventory when talking to her

### Door Rando changes

Because of the nature of door rando, there are a few changes to had to be made in order for everything to still work properly.
<br>

- A command has been added to respawn the player from the chosen starting location
- Some doors will always remain the same as they are in the original game
- The spawn points of a few doors have been modified
- Platforms have been added to the main bell room in Jondo
- The sword heart doesn't have to be unequipped for the Library bone puzzle
- The chalice will never unfill
- The Cistern shroud puzzle will be automatically completed if the shroud is equipped
- The Albero warp room can not be teleported to until activated, and the gate has been removed

### Corpse hints

Each of the 34 corpses in the game can give a hint about the location of a random valuable item.  These include beads, prayers, sword hearts, relics, quest items, stat upgrades, and skills.  However, there are a few specific corpses that will always hint at the same location, so that some of the more inconvenient locations can possibly be avoided.
<br>
These are:
- Corpse in ossuary --> Isidora reward
- Corpse outside Sierpes --> Sierpes reward
- Corpse in Ferrous Tree --> Miriam reward
- Corpse in Echoes of Salt --> Chalice quest sword shrine
- Corpse outside wax puzzle room --> Wax puzzle chest
- Corpse outside Jocinero's room --> Jocinero's final reward
- Corpse at entrance of WhOTW --> White Lady tomb reward
- Corpse outside Albero church --> 50,000 tear donation reward
