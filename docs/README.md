### Useful Info
- Only works on the most current game version (4.0.67)
- Press F8 to display the current seed (If you are stuck in dialogue use this to break out of it)
- Save & Quit can be used to instantly return to your last Prie Dieu, which can fix softlocks and makes the 'Return to Port' prayer useless
- Consult the spoiler generated in the game directory if you are stuck or believe the seed is unbeatable
- Do not load a vanilla game in the randomizer or vice versa
